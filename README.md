### Tips for Teaching Tech

* ##### Don’t overwhelm the person
  Help them to achieve the goal at hand, only push to show them more if they express an interest.
* ##### Patience, patience, patience
    It can be frustrating when technology doesn’t work like you want it to and you can’t figure out why. It can be twice as frustrating watching someone have this problem. Gently guide the person towards the solution, but don’t take control.
* ##### Don’t do it for them
  Show them where to go, how to navigate, and let them do the clicking and typing, no matter how slow or ineffective it might be. For the learner, practice makes perfect.
* ##### Reassure them
  No one was born knowing how to do any of this. We’ve all learned, and they can too! It doesn’t matter how young, old, or techphobic they proclaim to be, they can become just as savvy as any of us.
* ##### Assume they’re starting fresh, unless they say otherwise
   Don’t assume that they know any technical terms or even what we would consider to be “the basics”. Teach them the fundamentals and the foundation, then they’ll have a good base to build upon as they learn and seek out new things.  
* ##### Encourage them to write things down
   They will be taking in a lot of information and it will be good for them to have notes that they can go back to if they get lost or confused.   
* ##### Be upbeat, non-judgmental
   Encourage them, praise them when they accomplish things - it may sound silly, but positive reinforcement works! Many people think of tech teachers as rude or snippy - let’s break this preconception.  
* ##### Help them understand that software/web bugs and poor designs are sometimes the problem, not them
   Computers (and phones, and tablets, and websites) are dumb. They can’t think for themselves and can only do exactly what they are told. Sometimes things are made poorly for humans. It’s not always the patrons fault that they can’t get something to work the way they want. Help them find strategies for overcoming this.
